What is Photogram?

Photogram is a web based application, developed on MERN stack, with an idea around photographers and their skills. It is mainly used for photo uploads inside a gallery, where photographers can sort/filter the images using the metadata that is automatically extracted from each image when it is uploaded. Also, there are 3 dominant colors extracted, which later can be used by the gallery owner to filter the images based on a selected color. This idea started from the personal need to evolve in photography skills.
